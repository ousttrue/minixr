        <p>
          This sample demonstrates how to use an 'immersive-ar' XRSession to
          present a simple WebGL scene to a transparent or passthrough XR
          device. The logic is largely the same as the corresponding VR sample,
          with the primary difference being that no background is rendered and
          the model is scaled down for easier viewing in a real-world space.
